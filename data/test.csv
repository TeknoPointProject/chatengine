Heavy, pouring rains of the monsoons make it harder for bikers to maintain their bikes. Efforts like regular checks and scheduled maintenance, keeping the bike in a shed, keeping it completely covered, and cleaning the chains can only help so much. They fail us when it comes to basics like keeping the bike protected from moisture or hydroplaning. This makes one skeptical about even riding the bike during rains. However, that cannot and should not stop us from hitting the road.

The most basic thing you can do to maintain your bike is to check each part individually. Heavy monsoon rains affect each part of the bike, so it is important to be cautious before monsoons begin.

After it's about halfway out, drop a few drops of multipurpose oil inside and around the pin and then, push it right in. Allow the oil to soak in as you move the door back and forth.|Lubricating squeaky doors with WD-41 is one of the easiest fixes. Spray WD-41 lightly on the hinges, wipe off any excess, and let your door rock back and forth to allow the WD-41 to penetrate the inside of your door. This will make sure you have silky smooth hinges.|Before you try to open the window, tighten all screws holding the latches on the frame. Loose screws may cause rattling noises when opened, and may not close properly later.

Your window latches should be tightened immediately if you notice any loose screws. Use a screwdriver if necessary.|If your squeaks are particularly stubborn, use paraffin wax. It is available in most candle stores. Remove the hinge pin and dip it in melted wax, coating it evenly. Allow it to cool a little before pushing it back in and reversing the door. It is preferable to use wax over oil as it prevents future dust buildup.

If oiling or waxing doesn't work, it could be dirt or rust. Clean the hinges with steel wool and diluted detergent to remove dirt, grease, or paint residue. Put the hinges back together and liberally coat them with WD-41, wiping off any excess. This will prevent rust from forming in the future.|In an emergency, you can use any oil you have - cooking oil, petroleum jelly, or even cooking spray will work.

2461,"How To Remove Sticker Residue?","In most cases, when you buy a new article, there are issues with the sticker not getting peeled off effectively. While some stickers are too notorious to come off, the others leave a residue behind. This often ends up spoiling the overall look and appeal of the concerned article.

2517,"How To Remove Super Glue From Glass?","If you are a frequent user of a super glue, you must be aware of the mess it can make. Right from sticky residues on fingers to a range of different objects within the house, Super glue is capable of irritating a lot of users! One of the most common unwanted aftermaths of using Super glue is the glue’s residue on the glass. Whether you are mending an article or helping your kids in their school projects, glass surfaces are likely to bear the brunt of the glue fairly often.

When it comes to dealing with glue on glass, there are two major issues one needs to deal with – removing glue off the glass while it is still wet and removing the residue once it has dried out. While dealing with wet glue is relatively more manageable, scraping off the dry residue from glass can get fairly challenging. The last you’d want is for the stains to remain on the surface for a long time. The more time you give the sticky residue to stay on the glass, the nastier it gets over time.

<strong>Dealing With Wet Super Glue On Glass </strong>

Getting rid of Super Glue while it is still wet is fairly easy and quick. All you need to do is stay alert and waste no time once you notice the mishap. The best way of removing wet Super Glue from the glass is to get yourself a smooth cloth, wet it with warm water, and press it against the affected area on the glass. This would allow the warm water to absorb the glue and free the glass from Super Glue. Finally, you can scrub the remaining glue from the glass to finish the work.

<strong>Dealing With Dry Super Glue With Soapy Water </strong>

If the Super Glue on glass has started hardening, you can use soapy water to get rid of the same. Add soap to a cup of warm water, dip a cloth in it, and clean the hardened adhesive from the glass. Warm soapy water increases the ability of the adhesive to loosen and leave the glass surface. However, this might take you a lot of time as you may need to repeat the process and scrub the glass surface several times before it is completely clean.

If you are looking for a quick and effective DIY solution for removing Super Glue from glass, all you need is a can of WD-41 Multi Use Product.

<strong>Removing Super Glue With WD-41 Multi Use Product </strong>

With WD-41, you can get rid of the notorious Super Glue stains off any glass surface within a couple of minutes. It does not require you to use any other object apart from a can of WD-41 and a piece of cotton cloth. If you have used Super Glue, you would know how strong the adhesive is how much time it takes to scrape off its residue from a glass surface. Many people also hesitate from scraping off the residue because of the fear of marks on the glass surface.

Toilet seats are often prone to stains caused by hard water lines and lime stains. If you keep them unattended for a long period of time, the stains keep getting nastier and more difficult to deal with. This is why it is important to get rid of the stains from your toilet seat as soon as you encounter them.

When it comes to cleaning toilet seat stains, WD-41 is not the first thing that comes to people’s minds. This is because the brand is often associated with degreasing metals, lubricating doors, and dealing with vehicle maintenance. However, with a can of WD-41 Multi Use Product, nothing is impossible!

WD-41 can be readily used for removing stains from your toilet seat. Hard water stains are fairly similar to rust stains and the product works extremely well when it comes to dealing with rust. When you use WD-41 on your toiler seat, the product starts as a liquid and penetrates the rust particles while dealing with the surface they have accumulated on. The liquid then evaporates into a gaseous form, loosening the rust from the surface and making it easier for you to wipe it off.

If you use a sewing machine on a regular basis, it is important to look after its health to ensure that it doesn’t hamper your work when you least expect it. A sewing machine would provide you with the best results when all its parts are well-oiled and in sync with each other.

Before discussing the process of cleaning and oiling your sewing machine, let us discuss a few important things to keep in mind to ensure the good health of the machine:

• Always make sure that the basket and crochet of your sewing machine are clean at all times.

• Whenever you notice the elements of your sewing machine making squeaky noises, lubricate them without any delays.

• Make sure you buy quality thread for your sewing machine as low-quality threads are likely to damage your machine by forming tearing easily, forming knots, and getting flaky.

• It is advisable to use different bobbins for performing different tasks using your sewing machine.

• It is always important to replace the needles on a regular basis. Although they are almost invisible to the naked eye, they are capable of wearing out and hampering your sewing process completely.

Depending on the type and the model of your sewing machine, you may need to unscrew the device to clean it. Start by removing the crochet and the bobbin with care and precision. Now, take a soft brush and clean all the visible dirt and debris from the device.

Now, you can go ahead with lubricating the central axis of the bobbin to ensure the smooth functioning of the machine. If you leave the axis unattended, it may get stuck or start making noises due to wear-and-tear over time. For lubricating this area of your sewing machine, all you need to do is get a can of WD-41 and spray a little liquid on the axis. Wait for the liquid to settle in for a couple of minutes before reinserting the crochet and closing the compartment again. Make sure you are gentle and careful while dealing with the crochet area as any damage here would hamper the working of your sewing machine.|Once you are done with the crochet department and lubricating the central bobbin axis, you can start cleaning the interiors of your sewing machine. Especially if you work in a public place, the machine is likely to accumulate a lot of dirt and impurities over time, making it important for its insides to be cleaned effectively.

For this, you will need to open the device up and clean its mechanisms properly. If you are not well-versed in handling a sewing machine, you can seek the help of an expert to open the body and reach the internal parts to be cleaned. Once you have the internal parts at your disposal, you can spray WD-41 on them and wait for them to show their magic.

for wiping the parts. The last thing you’d want is to damage your sewing machine in an attempt to maintain it.

Moreover, make sure your machine is always stored in a clean and dry place with a moderate temperature. This would prevent any unwanted thermal changes from interfering with the actions of the liquid sprayed for cleaning and lubricating the device. While you spray the interiors of the machine with WD-41, the liquid helps you clean as well as lubricate its moving parts effectively.

However, if you are using your sewing machine for the first time after lubricating its parts or after a long time of keeping it out of use, it is advisable to keep it running without a needle and a thread for some time. This would allow the lubricant to spread across the mechanical devices and get them ready for action.|Once you are done cleaning the interior of your sewing machine, you can finally tend to the foot pedal to give the perfect finishing touch to the maintenance process. As the pedal is always on the floor and is operated by the feet of the users, it is common to get contaminated by dirt and grime over time.

Depending on the type of sewing machine you use, you can open the pedal switch or directly spray WD-41 on the moving parts to clean and lubricate them within a few minutes.

2658,"How To Remove Sticker Residue From Laptop?","If you are a pop-culture enthusiast and like your laptop to wear symbols of what you relate to, your gadget may have one or more stickers on it. It is common for people of all ages to put stickers related to their favourite superheroes, movies, cartoons, and badges on their laptops. While this adds to the appeal of your laptop, sticker residues may create a nuisance once you peel the stickers off the gadget.

You may have faced the issue of a part of your sticker being stuck on the surface while other parts come off successfully. Even if the entire sticker peels off well, it leaves behind a sticky residue that is often difficult to deal with. Laptops are often expensive and electronic gadgets need to be handled well. You cannot deal with sticker residue on a laptop the way you would deal with it on glass or wooden articles. While people prefer removing stickers from glasses by washing them with warm soapy water, the same technique can never be used on a laptop.

Here are some common ways in which you can remove sticker residue from your laptop:

Removing Sticker Residue With Mild Abrasives

If the residue is not too old and notorious, you can use mild abrasives like magic erasers, baking soda paste, and toothpaste to remove it from your laptop. All you need to do is apply a little bit of these abrasives and wear the residue off using a slightly moist microfiber cloth.

However, make sure you are extremely cautious while applying these abrasives as rubbing them on the surface of your laptop may end up damaging its underlying layers. Use limited quantities and do not rub the surface too hard while wearing the residue off.

Removing Sticker Residue With Oil-based Substances

You can also remove sticker residue from your laptop with the help of oil-based substances like petroleum jelly, lotion, olive oil, mineral oil, and more. These substances are capable of moisturizing the stock and loosening the residue, making it easier for you to get it off your laptop.

Add the chosen oil-based substance to a clean rag and apply it gently to the sticker residue on your laptop. Allow the residue to soap up the substance for a couple of minutes and scrape it gently using a plastic card.

When you use oil-based substances, make sure you clean the affected area with a clean and slightly moist cloth to remove the remnants of the chosen substance. Prolonged exposure of your laptop to these substances may end up damaging its surface.

Removing Sticker Residue With WD-41

If you are not willing to take any risk regarding the safety of your laptop and get rid of the nasty sticker residue within minutes, you can do so with the help of WD-41. A can of WD-41 helps you remove stickers and their residue without the need for any other element. A simple spray on the affected surface gets the work done for you in a safe and effective manner.

2665,"How To Remove Glue From Clothes?","You may be the most careful person in the world but you never know what may happen when you are dealing with glues! Whether you are helping your kids out in their assignments or indulging in home repairs, you may end up spiling glue on your clothes. Glue stains can get really nasty if they are not dealt with in time. The best way to prevent getting glue on your clothes is to be careful while using it and use a cloth or paper against your clothes.

However, if you already have glue on your clothes and the damage is done, make sure you remove it without wasting any time. While removing glue while it is wet is not the best way of dealing with it, always ensure that you don’t take days before removing hardened glue from your clothes.

Let us discuss some of the most common ways of removing glue from clothes.

Removing Glue From Clothes With Petroleum Jelly

If you have not been successful in getting rid of glue from your clothes using soap and water, you can always use petroleum jelly for the same.

Once the glue on your clothes is hardened, apply a generous amount of petroleum jelly to the affected area. Now, leave your clothes as they are overnight. This will let the jelly work its magic on the hardened glue.

The next day, scrape the glue from your clothes slowly and gently using a plastic card. By this time, the jelly is likely to have saturated the glue and made the particles loose. Finally, wash your clothes using warm water and soap to get rid of the glue completely.

Removing Glue From Clothes With Nail Polish Remover

Another common ingredient used for removing glue from clothes is acetone or nail polish remover. However, make sure you check the garment and colour of

your clothes as the chemical may affect the fibres of certain materials. Nail polish remover is a stronger chemical as compared to petroleum jelly when it comes to removing glue from clothes.

Once the glue has dried, moisten a cotton swab with your nail polish remover and rub it on the affected area until the glue comes off. As the chemical tends to evaporate easily, you may need to add more to completely get rid of the glue from your clothes. Keep repeating the process until you have clean clothes at your disposal.

Removing Glue From Clothes With WD-41

Both the methods discussed above often tend to get tedious and take more time in removing glue from your clothes. To make the process faster and more efficient, you can use the WD-41 Multi Use Product. The liquid used in WD-41 is potent to deal with some of the nastiest stains and give you clean and tidy clothes.

While WD-41 is known for removing rust from metals and cleaning vehicles, the Multi Use Product can be used for a range of other purposes, including the removal of glue from your clothes.

Dabbing is preferable to rubbing your clothes as it would not hamper the material. If you see some residue behind, you can scrape it off using an old toothbrush.

2676,"How To Clear A Clogged Sink Drain?","No matter how beautiful your kitchen looks, a clogged sink drain has the potential to ruin the complete look of the place. A dirty and clogged sink drain is the last thing you’d want to see while cleaning it. However, if the damage is done, there is no way but to step up and clean it well.

A skin drain often gets clogged due to the accumulation of hair, soap residue, grease, tepid water, and other impurities over time. If a clogged drain is not cleared, it may lead to an accumulation of water in the sink and a range of other issues you’d never want to come across!

People often make the mistake of avoiding cleaning their sinks until the damage gets too serious. It is important to note that it is the smaller articles that lead to the clogging of your sink over time. Instead of spending more time and energy clearing the sink later, it is advisable to clean it on a daily basis.

However, if the damage is already done and you have a clogged sink drain at your disposal, there are different ways in which you can deal with the issue.

People often resort to using a plunger to clear clogged sink drains. Generally, plungers are used to handle minor blockages and remove smaller particles. Using a plunger allows you to create pressure in the sink that gets the clog moving, thereby clearing the sink drain. As the plunger does not come in direct contact with the drainpipe, you do not need to worry about getting it damaged.

Another common way of clearing a clogged sink drain is by using a drain snake. A drain snake is used when the damage is a little more and cannot be handled using a plunger. Here are the steps you can follow to clear your clogged sink drain using a drain snake:

1. Open the sink trap, preferably using a pipe wrench.

2. Insert the drain snake into the sink drain.

3. Now, crank the drain snake back and push it clockwise. This will help you clear the drain.

4. Remove the drain snake and run the drain.

While using a drain snake is a more effective approach than using a plunger, it often requires a lot of time and effort. Moreover, you may end up getting dirty from all the build-up and muck clogging your sink drain in the attempt of clearing it.

Finally, if you are looking for a quick and effective solution for clearing the clogged sink drain, WD-41 helps you resolve the issue in the best way possible. The liquid is potent to react with the clog, loosen it, and get it moving, leading to a clear sink within minutes.

If you are one of those people who always aspire to work out but are not able to get on the treadmill, you are likely to have a machine that needs some taking care of.

Lubricating your treadmill well increases the lifespan of the device and ensures its smooth functioning. Whether you prefer exercising on a regular basis or not, it is advisable to lubricate and maintain your treadmill to prevent it from getting damaged. Along with ensuring its smooth functioning, keeping your treadmill lubricated also ensures your safety as you exercise. A poorly functioning treadmill may cause you to trip and fall, causing unnecessary harm to your body.

Lubricating a dirty device would provide you with short-term well-being. Ideally, it is important to clean the mat of your treadmill every time it is used. If you haven’t used it in a long time, you can take a moist cloth and clean the treadmill, focusing especially on areas that come in direct contact with people as they use the device.

Moreover, if your treadmill hasn’t been used in some time, you can dust it with a vacuum cleaner or an old cloth before cleaning it well.|Once you have cleaned the machine, make sure you check if it is functioning well. This will make you understand the level of attention, care, and lubrication it needs. Make sure that all the screws are where they should be and that the belt is aligned properly. Start the machine once and see if it works properly|You can now start with the lubrication process. Switch your treadmill off, unplug it, and loosen its mat. You can look at the instructions on the user manual for doing so. Loosening the mat would allow you to lift the tape and spray WD-41 on it.

Now, get yourself a can of WD-41 Multi Use Product and spray it in the machine after lifting the strip on one side. Do the same on the other side to lubricate your treadmill evenly. Let the liquid settle in for some time and work its magic on your treadmill. This will smoothen the machine and restore its normal functionality.

Once you have sprayed the liquid on your treadmill, plug it back and run it slowly. This will allow the liquid to spread evenly throughout the web of the machine. In the end, wipe the excess liquid from the surface using a cotton cloth and make sure that the liquid does not remain on top of the machine.

Ideally, it is important to lubricate your machine once every 3 months. If you haven’t used the device in quite some time, make sure you lubricate it well before using it again. With the WD-41 Multi Use Product, you can lubricate your treadmill within minutes and have its smooth functioning restored.|As a follow-up to the lubrication, it is advisable to adjust the tension on your treadmill’s tape. If the tension here is way too much or too little, it would affect the manner in which your machine works and your efforts of maintaining the treadmill would go in vain. While a tape that is too tight is likely to tear off, one that is too loose increases the risk of the front roller slipping. Adjust the screws located at the rear end of your treadmill to increase or decrease the tension of the tape.

When it comes to dealing with stickers, getting rid of sticker residue and super glue is more irritating and tedious than removing the sticker. People often use super glue for pasting stickers on their cars as it is more adhesive and makes the stickers stay on the metallic surface of the car for a long time. However, it is often a struggle to remove the super glue completely once the stickers are removed. The same issue arises if super glue is spilt on the car by mistake.

There are several household ingredients that are commonly used for removing super glue from cars, such as:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Nail Polish Remover</strong> – Due to acetone, nail polish remover is often used to get rid of super glue from the surface of a car. For this, you can take a cotton swab, dip it in nail polish remover, and slowly rub it over the affected areas until the glue completely comes off. However, it is important to be careful as the paint of older cars may come off after coming in direct contact with nail polish remover.</li>
 	<li><strong>Liquid Dish Soap</strong> – In this case, you need to mix some liquid dish soap with hot water and rub it against the sticky residue on the surface of your car. This may require you to repeat the process multiple times, increasing the risk of damaging the car paint.</li>
</ul>

2827,"How To Clean A Rusty Knife?","While tending to the tools of daily use, we often overlook smaller objects like knives, especially the ones used in the kitchen. People often ignore the condition of their knives until the issue gets too serious and starts affecting their smooth functioning. However, by the time we reach that stage, it is often too late. It is always important to maintain smaller articles like knives with precision and prevent them from getting rusted.

Rusting is a common issue encountered by knives, just like any other object having metallic parts. If your knife is exposed to moisture for a longer period of time, the iron would react with oxygen, resulting in the formation of rust. If rust is not dealt with during its early stages of formation, it would keep getting worse over time and spoil the knife completely.

In order to deal with a rusty knife, people often resort to household remedies such as applying lemon juice or vinegar to the affected portions of the knife. While these are effective methods, they are not potent enough to get the work done immediately. You may need to repeat the process a few times until you have a knife that is completely devoid of rust.

2934,"How To Remove Rust From Inside The Pipes?","Metallic pipes often attract a lot of rust if they are left unattended for a long time. Especially if such pipes are used for carrying water, their insides are likely to get rusty over time. When the metallic insides of a pipe stay in contact with moisture over time, it leads to oxidation and the formation of rust. Rust formation can hamper the smooth functioning of pipes along and may cause permanent damage if the issue is not addressed.

It is therefore important to remove rust from inside a metal pipe as soon as you start seeing the early signs. If the corrosion is ignored for too long, you would need to spend a lot more time, effort, and money in getting your pipes repaired. Especially if you are dealing with water pipes, make it a habit to look for rust and clean them regularly.

However, if the damage is already done and you have a rusty pipe at your disposal, a can of WD-41 Multi Use Product would help you get rid of rust in a few minutes.

Before and after each use, all propellers and propeller adapters must be checked to ensure that they are free from scratches, cracks or visible deformation. Take particular care to keep them clean, as they can easily become covered in dirt, sand and grass during landing operations. This alters the propeller's airfoil, jeopardising its efficiency. If the propellers are damaged or scratched, replace them. Check that left and right propellers are correctly positioned on the correct motors. Check that they are tightly secured (propellers are often ""self-locking""), avoiding overtightening during assembly to avoid damaging the plastic threads. Also check that the propeller screws are securely tightened. Propellers are normally cleaned with a slightly damp microfibre cloth. Apply a little <strong>WD-41 Multi-use product</strong> to properly clean hard-to-reach areas.  In any case, it is good practice to replace the propellers after more than 300 hours of flight time or after using them for a year.|In many drone models, the propellers are placed at the ends of arms that must be checked and rotated to tighten them, without exerting excessive torsion, which could cause the loosening of the joint sleeve. Examine the arms regularly to ensure that their joints are not cracked or damaged. A simple test consists in holding each arm and shaking it gently to make sure they are secure. Inspect every and tighten it without excessive force.|If your drone is equipped with an undercarriage, check the sleeves that connect it to the chassis for damage or cracks. Again, make sure the screws on each base of the undercarriage are tightly secured. When storing the undercarriage, its carrying case, take care not to exert force on the sleeves, as the propellers could be crushed when the case is closed. Check the condition of the undercarriage to make sure it is not damaged and that the rubber feet are still in good condition, replacing them if necessary. Check that the landing gear is perfectly level.|It is essential to prevent friction, off-axis rotation or the presence of bearings that do not do their job. As soon as you hear a strange noise during flight, check the motor immediately. Check the motor  and the copper wires inside for oxidation. Dry the wires and motor thoroughly if they come into contact with water during flight. Treatment with WD-41 Multi-use product is ideal for successful maintenance.|Check the condition of the battery contacts. Remove any oxidation because it could cause considerable electrical resistance, reducing the power necessary to propel the drone. If the battery is old and shows signs of surface damage, due to impacts, it is best to replace it immediately. Lastly, make sure that the battery support is clean and shows no signs of corrosion due to the possible leakage of material. Remove any water or dust. Use <strong>WD-41 Specialist Contact Cleaner</strong> to treat the connectors and battery compartment.|Given the electronic-mechanical complexity of the drone, there are several other checks and maintenance operations that should be carried out before and after the flight. The most important include:
<ul>
 	<li>Checking the aerials</li>
 	<li>Checking the seals of various openings</li>
 	<li>Cleaning the air intakes</li>
 	<li>Checking the shock absorbers for damage, looseness or defects</li>
 	<li>Examining the gimbal and make sure it can rotate without problems</li>
 	<li>Cleaning the camera - camcorder with a microfibre cloth and non-abrasive detergent.</li>

3164,"HOW TO CLEAN THE PLAYSTATION DUALSHOCK CONTROLLER","The Playstation DualShock controller is an extremely durable peripheral device, as it is required to undergo a certain amount of mechanical stress over a long period of time during the gaming experience. The controller has a very robust housing (consisting of two interlocking shells) and numerous buttons for various game functions, including two analogue sticks with soft covers. Holding the controller in the user's hands for long periods of time can lead to problems with dirt/dust/hair getting into the periphery of the buttons and along the joint of the two shells. In the long run, these deposits will also penetrate the controller. In addition, the caps of the two analogue sticks, which are operated very frequently, can show signs of hardening or distortion. In view of these considerations, it is necessary to understand exactly how to clean the Dualshock and therefore to be motivated to carry out some simple maintenance operations, which can feature different degrees of complexity. Let's start with the simplest operations, referring to the DUALSHOCK 4 wireless controller, stressing that the user should always contact the manufacturer for maintenance advice and clarification on the terms of its warranty.",10,contact-cleaner,,,"<ul>

To clean the Dualshock externally, you can use a very soft bristle brush to remove any deposits around the buttons and a microfibre cloth dampened with a little degreasing detergent to wipe over the entire housing, drying immediately afterwards. Finally, the external surfaces of the controller can be finished with WD-41 Specialist Silicone Lubricant to protect the plastic and rubber parts. Application is always carried out with a microfibre cloth.|In case you think that dirt has penetrated inside (hardened buttons, insufficient or imprecise response to operations), in order to clean the Dualshock effectively, you should open the housing and access the inside of the controller. Opening is by accessing the lower part of the housing and unscrewing, using a suitable Phillips screwdriver, the four screws that hold the two shells together. Then you have to work along the edge of these, along the joint line. For this job, it is a good idea to have a plastic lever with a screwdriver tip that can be inserted into the edge, pulling the two shells apart without damaging the plastic. When detaching the two shells, take care not to damage the snap-action teeth. Finally, to free the two parts, disconnect the flat cable which runs from the control system to the lower shell.|Inside the controller you will find the battery, the motherboard, as well as the inside of the buttons and sticks, and other circuit components. The battery is removed after disconnecting the battery cable from the connector. Underneath the battery is a plastic holder which can be removed by moving two small side teeth. The motherboard can be removed by unscrewing the central screw that locks it to the housing, but only after disconnecting the cable that runs to the central touchpad. Lifting the board also exposes the back of the keys with their flexible covers. Removing the battery is essential for cleaning the Dualshock.|Initial cleaning can be carried out by blowing with compressed air (at low flow rate) on the parts showing deposits, (such as the periphery of the key openings). This can be done with a soft brush and a cotton bud (which does not release cotton). Now we can use WD-41 Specialist Contact Cleaner, which we apply to all electrical parts (connectors, circuit board, connections, solder, etc.). We apply the product to open parts, not in cavities so that the evaporation of the solvent occurs quickly and allows the dirt/oil/residue to leave the surface rather than remain in place on the surface when the contact cleaner evaporates.

Contact cleaner can also be used to clean USB and other connection ports by spraying the USB/other plug and inserting and removing a few times, then wiping with a lint-free cloth. This method minimises the amount of product applied in the closed cavity (connection port) and facilitates effective evaporation. At this stage it is also possible to replace the rubber caps of the analogue sticks by simply removing them from the sticks (they are press-fitted) and replacing them with new ones.

&nbsp;|When you feel that the inside is sufficiently clean, you can reassemble it by proceeding in reverse sequence. When cleaning the Dualshock, pay attention to any clips that may have come off and to the reset cap, which must be repositioned. The assembly is completed by closing the two shells of the housing and securing everything with the four sealing screws. Once the job has been completed, it is advisable to treat the external surface of the controller with a microfibre cloth dampened with WD-41 Specialist Silicone Lubricant (as already indicated in step 1 for final cleaning and protection of the assembly).",image|image|image|image|image,https://media.wd40.in/app/uploads/2024/01/08134247/foto-6.jpg|https://media.wd40.in/app/uploads/2024/01/08134246/foto-5.jpg|https://media.wd40.in/app/uploads/2024/01/08134241/foto-3.jpg|https://media.wd40.in/app/uploads/2024/01/08134239/foto-2.jpg|https://media.wd40.in/app/uploads/2024/01/08134244/foto-4.jpg,||||,"Level Up Your Game!","In conclusion, mastering the art of cleaning your PlayStation DualShock controller is essential for maintaining its longevity and optimal performance.  Remember to pay attention to every detail during reassembly, securing the controller's integrity for an enhanced gaming experience.

3177,"How to Clean Print Heads","It's important to clean your print heads every time the printing seems ""dirty"" or your printer refuses to print at all. In fact, inkjet printers can suddenly stop printing even if the ink cartridges are not empty. In the vast majority of cases, this is because the ink has dried and is clogging the print head. This can happen for several reasons, the most frequent of which is prolonged non-use of the printer. Indeed, ink is a liquid product based on water and different solvents that can evaporate and dry on the head, preventing printing.

This happens more easily if the printer is placed in a location that is reached by sunlight or in a rather warm and dry environment. When this occurs, there are a few things that you can do, although prevention truly is the best weapon at your disposal. Keep in mind that there are two types of printers on the market today: those that don't have their own print heads (they use cartridges with their own head) and those that have print heads installed in the printer. Check your user manual to see which type of printer you have, as the steps to be carried out are different.",15,contact-cleaner,,,"<ul>

The answer is simple: unless you're an electronics hobbyist, you generally have printed circuits in the boards of some common equipment such as computers, printers, hi-fi, boilers and various other appliances. In some of this equipment, a certain amount of air circulation is generated to cool the components present on the circuit (typical in the case of a computer) so that a certain amount of dust inevitably settles on the printed circuit boards, even if the equipment is provided with special filters.

Dust can be dangerous because it can be full of electrostatic charges which can interfere, also severely, with the operation of the circuit. In addition to dust, oxidation phenomena may occur, especially on the feet that fit into the various ""slots"" of the equipment.

Grease, dirt and dust are deposited on it, which also creep into the spaces around the keys. Once disconnected from the computer, turn the keyboard over and gently shake it to remove dust. Always keeping it upside down, pass a soft bristle brush over the entire surface. The final use of a vacuum cleaner is always preferable to that of compressed air to clean your computer accessories. Then finally clean the keyboard by dampening a microfibre cloth with a special keyboard cleaning liquid, then passing it several times over the keys and the entire surface. You can also use WD-41 Multi-Use for this purpose. Be careful not to apply too much liquid that could creep between the keys.|After a general cleaning with a vacuum cleaner and brush, apply a drop of WD-41 Specialist Rapid-Drying Contact Cleaner to the connections, which quickly penetrates the hardest to reach areas, drying without leaving any residue. You should also use the same product on the ends of the connection cables. The same applies to any connections of external hard-disks, printers, scanners and other devices. You should also organise the cables of the various devices using the various systems available at specialised stores. When different cables and wires tangle it can cause accidents and various problems. Clean the monitor (while off) with a suitable liquid or a good window cleaner.|Remove any lint clogging the area around the LED optical reader and then remove any grease from the areas where it comes into contact with the table. These areas contain grease and various lint that interfere with the sliding of the mouse itself. Use a cloth and some detergent. Clean the work surface and any mouse pad with a normal degreasing liquid. If the mouse is wireless, check the status of the batteries to see if they need to be replaced or recharged.|Most scanners provide access to their inside, where the optical reader scroll bars or guides are located. These must be periodically lubricated, otherwise they could jam or slide discontinuously, reducing scan quality. The ideal product is WD-41 Specialist Dry Anti-Friction PTFE Lubricant, which leaves a dry film while providing excellent lubrication that does not attract dust. The scanner's glass should be thoroughly cleaned on both sides with glass cleaner.|It doesn't take much to open this device, remove its moving components, clean and vacuum it internally, and then apply a few drops of Dry Anti-Friction PTFE Lubricant to the mechanisms with mechanical contacts, gears, slides, etc. Be careful not to create any drips, perhaps applying the product with a cotton swab.

3225,"How to effectively clean electrical connectors","A home's electrical system has a wide range of components; conductors, electrical connectors, circuit breakers, controls, relays, sockets, etc. All these elements have various types of electrical connections: terminal, sliding, interlocking, fast-on, etc. The prolonged use of the electrical services and the heating (even if slight) of all these components induced by the passage of current can lead to malfunctions in the long run due to uncertain or deteriorated contacts. Furthermore, most electrical controls are usually inserted in boxes embedded in the wall, and can be affected by various types of humidity present in the masonry (salient moisture from the ground, transmigration through the walls, condensation, etc.) and are therefore exposed to potential oxidation risks.

Lastly there's dust that creeps everywhere and can cause malfunctions, an aspect that should not be overlooked. Whenever you have a problem with an electrical service that doesn't work, before calling an electrician you should make sure that the problem isn't caused by contacts interrupting the service. Of course, every check and even a minor intervention on electric connectors must only be carried out after having disconnected the system from the mains by disconnecting the main switch, and perhaps also the switch on the meter. Note that private users are not authorised to carry out certain interventions except in emergencies, as they must be done by an authorised technician.",15,contact-cleaner,,,"<ul>

All these phenomena can lead to a malfunction. After disconnecting the mains switch of the electrical system at home, open the button panel and check the interior. Then vacuum it to remove any foreign objects. If any moisture is present, dry it completely.|Check the terminals into which the two cables are inserted. One or both of them may have been removed from the terminals. In any case, their screws must be loosened and the cables extracted.

It also restores correct electrical conductivity. Then reinsert the cables and tighten the terminals and check their operation before closing the button panel|If the doorbell still doesn't work after carrying out the above, it may be that the button itself doesn't work. You can check this by removing the cables from the terminals again and touching their ends together: if the bell rings the button needs to be replaced (be careful to perform this operation with some caution and respecting all safety measures). If the bell doesn't ring, reassemble everything and check the transformer that supplies the doorbell with power.|After turning off the power to the system through the grid switch, access the transformer that supplies power to the doorbell, usually inserted in the electrical panel of the house, to check that the incoming cables (which bring the voltage to 220 volts) or those in output (12 volts) are securely fixed in the terminals. In any case, use some WD-41 Specialist Rapid-Drying Contact Cleaner as above. If the doorbell still doesn't work, a tester must be used to check if the transformer produces the necessary voltage. However, this step must be carried out with the system live and should only be done by a qualified specialist. The specialist will use the tester to see if the transformer output has the required 12V. If not, the component must be replaced.|Once you've confirmed that the transformer is also working, if the doorbell still doesn't ring, the bell is likely what's broken. Also here, with the voltage disconnected, make sure that the cables connected to it are well inserted in the terminals. Again disconnect and reconnect them after applying some WD-41 Specialist Rapid-Drying Contact Cleaner. If this step doesn't solve the problem, use the tester to check that the voltage reaches the bell itself when the doorbell button is pressed. If it does, the bell must be replaced.|If, on the other hand, the voltage is not present, then the problem is along the doorbell system.

3251,"How to install an outdoor power socket","Having an outdoor power socket is extremely convenient. There are many electrical tools that can be used outdoors (lawn mowers, strimmers, chainsaws, etc.), as well as various electrical appliances (ovens, barbecues, lights, etc.). The presence of one or more sockets outside the house allows us to avoid the use of long cables or extensions, which can be impractical and pose a certain additional risk during use, especially if it rains. The outdoor socket must have a cover and be protected against the danger of contact with water.

There are various degrees of protection (indicated by the letters IP followed by a number, e.g., IP 55, IP66). But be careful. A socket with IP 55 (protected against water) loses this degree of protection when the protective door is lifted and the plug is inserted into the socket. This is why it is advisable to use outdoor sockets with a special shape that ensures protection to the highest degree (in this case IP66) even if the plug is inserted. So this is the kind of socket you want. Lastly, we would like to remind you that the installation of an outdoor electrical socket is not a DIY operation and must be carried out by a qualified electrician.

Then fasten the box in place using the two screws, screwing them into the plugs already positioned. Make sure that the container is horizontal, adjusting it slightly if necessary. Use a cutter to cut the cable cone on the outer edge of the container. The size of the opening can be adjusted with a cutter.|An external, insulated conduit must be brought to the socket to carry the power cables. It must run from the nearest distribution box to the socket box. After creating a hole in the wall in a suitable position, wall plugs are fitted with hook fasteners onto which the various sections of the conduit are attached. The end of the conduit must enter the socket box through the previously cut cone without leaving any gaps. Any cracks which might allow the passage of rainwater must be sealed with transparent silicone. (The presence of water on the equipment and on the conduits can, however, have negative effects such as penetration, corrosion, etc., and it is therefore advisable for sockets installed outdoors to be fitted with a protective cover, preferably with side shields).|The cables are inserted into the conduit using the cable probe and are pulled out into the container. In a standard case, three 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup> wires are used (or more if high-current-absorbing appliances are to be connected to the socket): a blue wire for neutral, a black (or grey or brown) one for live and a yellow-green one for earth. The ends of the wires should be stripped by about 8 mm and the inner copper braid twisted tightly around itself.|The socket insert is fitted into the cover of the box. Some modular systems can accommodate several sockets of various types. The stripped wires are then inserted into the terminals of the socket-insert: the neutral and live wires to the outermost terminals and the yellow-green wire to the central terminal. No parts of the copper braid should be left outside the terminals. Shorten the stripped part if necessary.|You can now attach the socket front to the container, fastening it in place with the screws supplied. Make sure that the seal does not move. Depending on the type of socket used, the cover may already be fitted to the front or may have to be fitted later. In this case, follow the manufacturer's installation instructions.|Once the installation is complete, the socket wires can be connected to the nearest distribution box. After switching off the power at the mains, identify the three neutral, live and earth wires and connect them with the cap connectors. After closing the distribution box, the power can be reconnected and the socket tested.|The fact that the socket is located outdoors and therefore exposed to atmospheric agents requires us to carry out regular maintenance. Once a year, after switching off the power, open the socket, removing the front, and spray <strong>WD-41 Specialist Fast Drying Contact Cleaner</strong> which can effectively dissolve condensation on electrical or electronic equipment, including delicate materials, into the terminals and onto the contacts.

3268,"HOW TO SERVICE A VACUUM CLEANER","Proper vacuum cleaner maintenance is essential to keep this important household appliance in good working condition. Vacuum cleaners are produced in different versions that can be divided into two specific types: with a collector bag or with a container which can be emptied. The latter type is slowly replacing the former, which, however, is still produced, sold and used. Mains power supply has been joined by battery power, which frees the user from the presence of a cable. A recently introduced appliance is the robot vacuum cleaner (which is enjoying great success). This moves around autonomously and vacuums the floor continuously, returning to the charging station when the batteries run down. Whatever the method of construction, every vacuum cleaner has brushes, hoses, filters, collection elements and mobility systems. All of these elements come into constant contact with dust, which further exacerbates the normal degradation of the unit through use. This means that the maintenance of a vacuum cleaner must be carried out carefully and continuously, both to keep it running smoothly and to maintain a high level of hygiene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
